# FEP3370-HT22-50570-Advanced-Ethical-Hacking

In this work, we are going to see two different vulnerability exploitation in the vulnerable versions of Apache Airflow. Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow management platform that performs distributed task scheduling, i.e., it considered as a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.
